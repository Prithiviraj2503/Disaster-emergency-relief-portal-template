# Disaster-emergency-relief-portal-template

I developed this project to enhance my skill on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap4.
The main Idea of this proposed website is to provide an integrated service to the social through a comon site. For example health service volunteer register to this site, If anywhere in a need of volunteer the he will be redirect to there. Like the same idea will be applied for funding, relief things providing, ragufee registeration, shelter integration and ..ect.
